# **MiniTemplate Project**

## **Benefits of the Unified Component Approach**

This project uses a unified component structure, ensuring that every element is self-contained and standardized. This approach offers several key benefits:

1. **Simplicity**: There are no package managers or complex dependency management involved, which makes development straightforward and less prone to errors.
2. **Consistency**: Every component follows the same structure, making development predictable and easy to manage.
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different sections of the project without modification, reducing redundancy.
4. **Maintainability**: Self-contained components make debugging and feature enhancements easier, as each component includes its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. **Scalability**: As your project grows, new components can be easily added and integrated without disrupting existing functionality.

## **Why This Approach Is Better**

With the unified component approach, you no longer need to worry about managing complex package dependencies. All components are self-contained, meaning that they work seamlessly together while reducing the risk of conflicts. This approach avoids overcomplicated dependency struggles seen with some other frameworks and libraries.

## **Component Example**

Below is an example of a fully self-contained component. You can copy and paste it into any `.html` file—whether as part of an existing file or into a new, empty one—and it will render immediately without any further setup.

For more components and inspiration, see [DaisyUI Components](https://daisyui.com/components/).

```html
<div id="exampleComponent" class="flex justify-center items-center p-4">
    <button class="btn btn-primary">
        Click Me
    </button>
    <script>
        // Dynamically load CSS for Tailwind and DaisyUI (if not already included in your template.html or base file)
        (function() {
            const loadCSS = (url) => {
                const link = document.createElement('link');
                link.rel = 'stylesheet';
                link.href = url;
                document.head.appendChild(link);
            };
            loadCSS('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css');
            loadCSS('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@2.14.1/dist/full.css');

            // set the theme:
            document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'cyberpunk');

            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
                const button = document.querySelector('#exampleComponent .btn');
                button.addEventListener('click', function() {
                    alert('Button Clicked!');
                });
            });
        })();
    </script>
</div>
```

This component:
- Loads the necessary CSS for both Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI dynamically.
- Applies the DaisyUI `cyberpunk` theme by default (you can change the theme easily).
- Includes inline JavaScript to handle component-specific functionality.

### **How to Use This Component**
You can copy this block of code and save it as a `.html` file. It will render directly in any browser with the proper Tailwind and DaisyUI styling applied. To switch themes, change the `data-theme` attribute to any other theme from the available themese here:[DaisyUI Components](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## **Technologies Used**
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **DaisyUI**: A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, offering pre-designed UI elements and themes.

## **Theming with DaisyUI**
DaisyUI comes with a wide range of themes that can be applied to customize the look and feel of your project.

### **Available Themes**
The following themes are available:
- light
- dark
- cupcake
- bumblebee
- emerald
- corporate
- synthwave
- retro
- cyberpunk
- valentine
- halloween
- garden
- forest
- aqua
- lofi
- pastel
- fantasy
- wireframe
- black
- luxury
- dracula
- cmyk
- autumn
- business
- acid
- lemonade
- night
- coffee
- winter
- dim
- nord
- sunset

### **How to Apply a Theme**
To apply a theme, run the `generate.sh` script and pass the theme name as an argument.

```bash
./generate.sh [themeName]
```

If no theme is provided, the default theme `business` will be used.

## **How to Create Components**
Since all components follow the same structure, creating a new component is simple. There’s no need to differentiate between "default" or "custom" components—everything works under a unified approach.

### **Generating the Project**
1. Run the `generate.sh` script to generate the `index.html` page based on the template and components you’ve created.

```bash
./generate.sh
```

2. Follow the prompts to choose the page title and theme.

## **Handling Naming Collisions**

This project ensures that each component is self-contained, and naming collisions or variable conflicts are avoided. Variables and functions within each component are encapsulated, preventing conflicts with other parts of the application.

To further prevent global variable collisions, JavaScript is wrapped in anonymous functions or immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE). CSS is dynamically loaded and scoped only to the necessary parts.

## **Optimizing for Production**

For production environments, you can optimize your CSS by purging unused styles. This reduces the file size of your CSS, improving performance.

### **Purge Example:**

You can use a tool like `purgecss` to remove unused styles:

```bash
npx purgecss --css path-to-your-css-file.css --content path-to-your-html-file.html --output path-to-output.css
```

This optional step is especially helpful when deploying to production, as it reduces the overall load time of your project.

This setup allows for fast prototyping and a flexible, component-based design approach using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
